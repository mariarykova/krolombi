I always took pride in what I do and how I wear my hair, which included lots of different hair accessories. Modern online retail offer so many options for how to make your hair look classy/funky/cozy (whichever you prefer) which is amazing but I decided to remind myself of one thing that I particularly like - which is making hair accessories myself using regular scarfs, headscarfs and so on. In the carousel you can find my handpicked selection of hair accessories for different occasions and a few inspiring references in the stories. Enjoy! ‚ú®",
