                This session will give you a clear understanding about the items that you already have: which ones work for you and which ones don’t. By exploring your wardrobe I will help you to edit and organise your clothes into ready-towear outfits. We will create new combinations so you can see your clothing in an absolutely new light. I will identify what needs updating or no longer fits you.This session covers shoes and accessories management and I will help you to mix and match items together to see what needs updating. All of us have clothing that no longer fits us or we just simply feel like it doesn’t represent who we are. I will offer my advice on how to re-sell or recycle the garments that don’t belong in your wardrobe any longer. After the wardrobe detox we will create a shopping list of the missing key items to create a proper basic capsule. Don’t worry, we will cover every aspect of your life - from workwear, to party wear , sleek smart casual or weekend relaxed looks. By the end of the session, you will have a 360 degree overview of what you already own and how it can be used in your day-to-day life.
